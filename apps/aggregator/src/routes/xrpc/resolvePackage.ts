/**
 * `com.emdashcms.experimental.aggregator.resolvePackage` — handle/slug →
 * package view. Convenience wrapper that:
 *
 *   1. Resolves the handle to a DID via the publisher's DID document.
 *   2. Looks up the package by (resolved DID, slug).
 *
 * Throws `HandleNotFound` when handle resolution fails (publisher's
 * `_atproto` TXT record / `.well-known/atproto-did` file missing or
 * mismatched). Throws `NotFound` when handle resolves but no package is
 * indexed under (did, slug).
 *
 * Resolution path: bidirectional handle resolution per atproto spec
 * (`@atcute/identity-resolver`'s `HandleResolver`). We deliberately don't
 * cache the handle→DID mapping at the aggregator: handles are mutable and
 * resolvable on every request keeps the contract honest. If/when this
 * becomes a hot path, add a short-TTL cache here keyed by handle.

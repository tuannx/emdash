/**
 * Records Jetstream DO: holds a long-lived outbound WebSocket to Jetstream,
 * filters our experimental package collections, and enqueues verification
 * jobs onto the Records Queue.
 *
 * Why a DO at all: outbound WebSockets stay open across requests, but a
 * Worker isolate doesn't. A single DO instance keeps the connection alive
 * continuously. The Hibernation API doesn't apply here — it's server-side
 * only, and our connection is outbound.
 *
 * The DO is thin by design — all the loop / cursor / backoff logic lives in
 * `JetstreamIngestor`. The DO just wires real bindings into the ingestor;
 * its `fetch` handler returns the current ingestor status for the
 * `/_admin/start` bootstrap path and any later admin/status surface.

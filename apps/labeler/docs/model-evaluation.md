# Listing moderation model evaluation

The labeler automatically approves listing metadata only when the selected text models complete
with no findings and every displayed image also passes. Findings and incomplete assessments remain
hidden for operator review.

## Selected models

The automatic moderation bundle uses the following Workers AI catalog models:

- Text: unanimous results from `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast` and
  `@cf/zai-org/glm-5.3-flash`
- Images: `@cf/zai-org/glm-5.3-flash`, with thinking disabled and a 512-pixel WebP derivative

The text prompt is `listing-text-v9`, with content hash
`aee2551bd26b942ef2f67fa3137ad0d16eb5b502a376a2df410486d4fe37b1c5`. The image prompt is
`listing-image-v7`, with content hash
`7215746880df62b42448d3e9f5c8f5709f9071906ab705ffa8889c51ab8817b0`. The runtime computes
these hashes from the embedded prompts; operators do not configure separate prompt-hash values.

## Moderation-manipulation evaluation

Text prompt `listing-text-v9`, with content hash
`aee2551bd26b942ef2f67fa3137ad0d16eb5b502a376a2df410486d4fe37b1c5`, adds
`moderation-manipulation` for direct attempts to alter, bypass, suppress, or predetermine automated
moderation. Quoted or descriptive discussion remains benign. It also excludes unsupported usage,
performance, testimonial, and other marketing claims unless the submitted content itself identifies
fabrication, forgery, nonexistent evidence, or a contradiction. Image prompt `listing-image-v7`,
with content hash `7215746880df62b42448d3e9f5c8f5709f9071906ab705ffa8889c51ab8817b0`, applies the same
distinctions.

A three-repeat run evaluated the 20-case public text corpus with the new category. No model passed
the complete zero-error budget:

- Llama 3.3 produced the correct pass or review outcome in all 60 runs, with no invalid output,
  model error, or repeated-run disagreement. It added an extra category to three expected-review
  cases. P95 latency was 5.66 seconds.
- GLM 5.3 Flash classified the manipulation fixtures correctly. A sequential retry confirmed the
  multilingual phishing and long benign cases, but all three Unicode-confusable responses omitted
  a benign evidence reference and were rejected by the coverage contract.
- Kimi K2.7 Code produced no unsafe pass, but had five invalid outputs, nine repeated-run
  disagreements, and 65.79-second P95 latency.

The Llama and GLM artifact has SHA-256 digest
`fc2318bef43f0f8696e650a130ed48f448f6d2827b3307d730e37becf16f1fa6`. The Kimi artifact has
digest `9a4f514af712e56a005a2d73bd55d5ee7fadd3a53fb8ab06d9acdd2a153dba0a`, and the sequential GLM
retry has digest `d175ac9ae4cbabbd09eb559fd78dab01d5ac0d6036f03db6e6f5766cc249b026`.

Qwen 3.8 matched the expected outcome and categories in all 18 repeated public image runs under
image prompt v7. It had no invalid output, model error, coverage failure, or repeated-run
disagreement. P95 latency was 4.05 seconds. The artifact has SHA-256 digest
`ace1216c7d19e489559cf39195703f515d9725462ab2749b2c9aa5d5148276c0`.

GLM 5.3 Flash also matched all 18 public image outcomes under image prompt v7. One repeat added a
phishing category to the screenshot that already required review for moderation manipulation; all
other categories matched. P95 latency was 4.96 seconds. The artifact has SHA-256 digest
`24c31f4b4aea37be4f61293ed663f85dba8dd687913f66ccd01e4380d8104f18`.

A separate private-image check selected GLM as the image candidate because it caught nudity and
hateful imagery that Qwen missed. Catching unsafe imagery takes precedence over Qwen's cleaner
category result on the public regression fixtures.

A local v2 protected text fixture added `moderation-manipulation` to 21 direct bypass commands and
left 10 quoted documentation controls unchanged. Its commitment is
`1f6649bcece0bd079d97454aeada1c131d59bac2c1d5baa0dabaac8a0e28b3a2`. A three-repeat Llama run
evaluated 320 public and protected text cases. All 69 runs expected to identify manipulation did so,
and no expected-pass case went to review under that fixture. The fixture incorrectly expected
unsupported installation-count claims to review. Under the corrected policy, the result contains
six distinct unsafe passes for a recovery-phrase and password request, plus three distinct false
positive reviews for the unsupported claim. The run had no invalid output, model error, or coverage
failure. Fourteen cases disagreed on additional categories, but none disagreed on pass or review.
P95 latency was 5.17 seconds. The artifact has SHA-256 digest
`69aec3a944e965200bebe291d13a633d50a3a53d6d37814dd2cb912b24889f33`.

A focused text regression used a local v3 protected fixture with commitment
`542de52832d2689c91ba94d331bd12349c976e9ce9a76c0e4306301bc10b271e`. Llama matched the
expected pass or review outcome in all 105 runs, with no invalid output, model error, coverage
failure, or repeated-run disagreement. All unsupported installation-count variants passed, while
the variant containing a direct bypass command reviewed for manipulation only. P95 latency was
2.76 seconds. The artifact has SHA-256 digest
`91938a482d63f191b5f65fba097f6347ac17359701dd122ca414ceb810f44926`.

The focused checks informed the unanimous automatic-pass evaluation below.

## Candidate selection

The candidate sweep started from the live Workers AI catalog rather than a fixed list from model
documentation. It evaluated current general models, older controls, specialist moderation models,
and native vision interfaces. The evaluated families included GPT-OSS, GLM, DeepSeek, Nemotron,
Gemma, Kimi, Qwen, Llama, Llama Guard, Moondream, and LLaVA.

The public development corpus contains 27 fixtures: 21 text cases and six image cases. It covers
all nine finding categories, clean inputs, borderline wording, prompt injection, Unicode
confusables, multilingual text, long input, and redacted realistic input. The development sweep
also found provider-interface differences that required support for OpenAI-compatible choice
envelopes, provider-parsed objects, native vision inputs, server-sent event responses, and models
whose native thinking mode must be disabled.

The first broad sweep passed the output schema directly as `response_format.json_schema`. The live
schemas for current OpenAI-compatible models instead require
`json_schema: { name, schema, strict }`. The earlier invalid-JSON results for DeepSeek V4, Gemma 4,
GLM, GPT-OSS 120B, Kimi, Nemotron 3, Qwen 3.8 text, and Llama 3.2 Vision therefore mix adapter
incompatibility with model behavior and cannot be used as model-quality evidence.

A four-case diagnostic used the nested strict schema and disabled thinking for GLM 5.2 and Kimi
K2.7 Code. GLM returned valid, correct JSON for all four cases. Kimi handled the two simpler cases,
but exhausted 1,024 completion tokens and returned empty content for the two phishing cases. With
`max_completion_tokens` and low reasoning effort, Kimi handled the prompt-injected phishing case
at 1,227 completion tokens. The Unicode-confusable case still exhausted 4,096 completion tokens
and returned empty content. Raw provider responses were retained for these diagnostics.

A corrected one-pass GLM 5.2 run covered all 318 text fixtures. Two transient provider errors were
retried, and all fixtures received a model response. Twenty-three expected-review rows resolved to
pass: 12 rows represented five distinct phishing patterns, while 11 were synthetic lookalike-link
variants whose expectations require separate validation. Six responses exhausted the 2,048-token
limit while emitting an unfinished JSON object followed by whitespace. GLM did not send a clean
case to review. P95 latency was 9.93 seconds. The artifact has SHA-256 digest
`6275ba4f4bd3d1bff8c7b0c7247bd53029a87378a9874053d89b743740b9441e`.

On the earlier public corpus, Llama produced 51 valid text results across three repeats without a
pass/review error. The password-form screenshots are benign negative controls: an image of a
credential form is passive UI evidence and cannot establish phishing or credential solicitation.
Under image prompt v5, Qwen matched all six corrected image outcomes and categories without an
invalid output or model error. P95 latency was 33.35 seconds, above the 15-second evaluation
budget. Exact category assignments remain an advisory quality metric rather than an automatic-pass
safety claim.

## Protected validation

The first protected corpus contained 400 cases: 300 expected-review cases, 100 expected-pass
cases, and 100 images. It was used for candidate selection and is retained separately from the
promotion holdout.

Llama caught every prohibited text case but sent four clean variants of the same independent
compatibility statement to review. The statement was added to the public development corpus, and
the text prompt was clarified to treat explicit independent, unaffiliated, or compatibility-only
statements as non-impersonation. Llama then passed the public regression and five protected
variants in all 18 repeated calls.

Nemotron 3 was the only alternative text model to pass the 55-case clean screen without an
error. A later screen against 15 hard prohibited cases produced five unsafe passes, six model
errors, one invalid output, and three correct reviews. GLM 5.2 and GPT-OSS 120B each failed a
clean case during the earlier screen, before the response-format correction. None replaced Llama.

## Unanimous automatic moderation

The automatic-pass candidate runs Llama 3.3 and GLM 5.3 Flash in parallel over the same text and
link evidence. It returns a clean result only when both models complete with no findings and cover
every evidence reference. A finding, timeout, invalid output, missing reference, or provider error
keeps the listing out of automatic discovery. The candidate does not issue automatic blocks.

A paced one-repeat GLM screen evaluated all 321 public and protected text fixtures with the
production 20-second deadline. It produced no unsafe pass. GLM sent one public unsupported
marketing claim to review, omitted an evidence reference on two expected-review fixtures, and
timed out on one expected-review fixture. All 50 protected expected-pass text fixtures passed. P95
latency was 6.29 seconds. The artifact is stored at
`development/2026-09-09/glm-full-sequential.json` in `emdash-labeler-eval-artifacts`; its SHA-256
digest is `f888aa278f651ecd53575ec18c03f0525d3ef02aa83111142cf2bc1bd68fc132`.

The production-equivalent unanimous adapter then evaluated the 21 public text fixtures. It
produced no unsafe pass and no benign review. One benign claim and one prohibited confusable-login
fixture failed closed because a member omitted an evidence reference. P95 latency was 5.82 seconds.
The artifact is stored at `development/2026-09-09/unanimous-public.json`; its SHA-256 digest is
`74314208c545046782bec23f39a4ae103772a8d6b4ec9693b88164c31faac5f9`.

Alternative verifier screening did not displace GLM:

- GPT-OSS 120B produced no unsafe pass on the phishing, manipulation, and benign-control subset,
  but seven prohibited cases failed closed because of invalid output or provider errors.
- DeepSeek V4 Flash returned well-formed output with 2.40-second P95 latency, but passed 23
  prohibited phishing fixtures.
- Kimi K2.6 calls took 28 to 79 seconds during the screen and exceeded the production deadline.

The alternative artifact is stored at
`development/2026-09-09/verifier-alternatives.json`; its SHA-256 digest is
`7ebb2cd1ab1baf0ed4b92ca032b027cb7736a34ffb1eaba00e23e29953d40668`.

These development runs select the unanimous Llama and GLM bundle. Safe fallbacks on expected-pass
fixtures must remain at or below five percent, and any automatic pass on an expected-review fixture
rejects the candidate. Continue checking representative private images separately because the
protected holdout was used during model selection and does not cover `moderation-manipulation`.

## Rejected single-model evaluation

The frozen three-repeat evaluation used promotion dataset
`d9b8ecfec2b9662e193b6a927939c9d72d966ab0ffc805916b337658dea5dbb6`. Its artifact has SHA-256
digest `0ee8eedfc76288d713823788dd1ec3baa5ce846959e9ec15d90b19d6c9fc14a4`.

The combined run made 1,275 model calls. It produced no invalid model output, model error, coverage
failure, or missing usage record. P95 model latency was 9.30 seconds. The decision gates failed:

- 38 protected prohibited fixtures passed in at least one repeat.
- 14 fixtures changed decision or category across repeats.
- 109 individual repeated runs disagreed with the expected pass/review outcome.

Fifteen fixture rows were text failures, but they represented four unique strings. Six duplicate
rows contained one credential-solicitation sentence that Llama missed in every repeat. Two unique
prompt-injection cases each failed in one of three repeats. Seven duplicate rows asserted an
independently measured installation count without giving the model evidence that the count was
false; those rows were not valid misleading-claim tests. The genuine phishing misses and repeated
disagreement still block automatic passing.

Twenty-three unsafe fixtures were images. The generated images were text-only cards rather than
representative visual content, and visual inspection found that the PNGs omitted their body text
because the SVG renderer did not paint the `foreignObject` content. Those image results do not
establish a Qwen regression. The genuine text failures are sufficient to reject the model bundle
without relying on the defective image cases.

The dataset manifest keeps `promotionEnabled` set to `false` because this corpus was consumed during
model selection. The flag describes the evaluation dataset; it does not control runtime moderation.

## Evaluation acceptance criteria

Use all of the following criteria when selecting an automatic moderation bundle:

- Three or more repeats.
- At least 300 protected expected-review fixtures and 100 protected expected-pass fixtures.
- At least 100 protected image fixtures and 30 protected fixtures for every finding category.
- No unsafe pass in any repeat.
- At most five percent of expected-pass runs falling back to review or error.
- P95 latency and configured usage within the committed budgets.

An invalid output, model error, incomplete coverage result, or disagreement cannot produce an
automatic pass. It is therefore a safe fallback, but it counts against the five-percent operational
budget when the fixture is expected to pass. The same failure on an expected-review fixture remains
hidden and does not reduce automatic-admission coverage.

Zero unsafe passes across 300 independent expected-review cases gives a one-sided 95% binomial
upper bound just below 1%. This calculation assumes representative independent cases; synthetic
variations alone do not establish the same real-world error rate. Render and inspect generated
images before treating their outcomes as evidence.

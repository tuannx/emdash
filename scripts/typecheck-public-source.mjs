/**
 * Guard: no subpath export ships raw TypeScript source.
 *
 * `emdash` used to expose `./routes/*`, `./api/*`, `./auth/providers/*` (and
 * more) as raw `./src/*.ts`. `skipLibCheck` does not skip `.ts`, so a strict
 * consumer's `tsc` type-checked our source and its transitive graph against
 * their config -- and, because the raw source imported `Database` etc. from
 * `src` while `emdash/locals` provided the compiled `dist` identity, hit a
 * dual-package type-identity wall (issue #1053 was one symptom).
 *
 * The fix was structural: those subpaths are now compiled to
 * `dist/*.mjs` + `dist/*.d.mts`, so consumers only ever see declarations
 * (`skipLibCheck` covers them). This guard keeps it that way: it fails CI if
 * any subpath export target is a raw `.ts`/`.tsx` file again.
 *
 * Documented exception: modules that bridge into `.astro` cannot be compiled
 * (the consumer's Astro build must process the `.astro`), so they ship as
 * source by necessity, exactly like the `.astro` files themselves. The
 * allowlist below names them; `.astro` targets are always fine.
 *
 * This replaced an earlier fixture-based consumer-typecheck harness: once raw
 * source is not shipped, there is no raw-source graph to type-check, so a
 * static export-shape check is the whole guarantee.

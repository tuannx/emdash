/**
 * Generate the JSON Schema for `emdash-plugin.jsonc` from the Zod source
 * of truth in `src/manifest/schema.ts`.
 *
 * Run via `pnpm gen-schema` (wired into `build`). The output is committed
 * to `schemas/emdash-plugin.schema.json` and shipped in the package's
 * `files` array so users can reference it via:
 *
 *     "$schema": "./node_modules/@emdash-cms/plugin-cli/schemas/emdash-plugin.schema.json"
 *
 * Drift between the Zod schema and the committed JSON Schema is caught by
 * `tests/schema-drift.test.ts`, which compares the committed file against a
 * freshly generated one after normalizing line endings to LF.
 *
 * Why a separate script rather than emitting on build:
 *
 *   - The schema is part of the package's user-facing surface; checking
 *     it into git makes diffs visible in PR review (a field rename in
 *     Zod produces a tracked diff in the JSON Schema too).
 *   - Tests can run without first building. The schema file exists
 *     at-rest; the test compares Zod's current output to it.
 *
 * Runs under Node's native TypeScript stripping (Node 22+). No `tsx` or
 * `ts-node` dependency.

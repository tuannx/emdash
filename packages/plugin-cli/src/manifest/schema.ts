/**
 * Zod schema for `emdash-plugin.jsonc` — the publisher-authored manifest that
 * sits next to a plugin's source and feeds the registry CLI's `publish`,
 * `validate`, and `init` commands.
 *
 * Relationship to the lexicon
 * ---------------------------
 *
 * This schema is NOT the lexicon. The lexicon
 * (`com.emdashcms.experimental.package.profile`) is the on-wire atproto
 * record format, optimised for content-addressed storage and aggregator
 * indexing. This schema is the authoring format, optimised for a human
 * editing a file in VS Code with `$schema`-powered IDE completion.
 *
 * Fields that exist in BOTH places use the lexicon's field names verbatim
 * (`license`, `keywords`, `repo`, `name`, `description`). Fields that the
 * publisher cannot reasonably write by hand are derived at publish time and
 * do not appear here: `id` (full AT URI requires the publisher's DID),
 * `type` (always `"emdash-plugin"` from this CLI), `slug` (derived from the
 * bundled `manifest.json`'s `id`), `lastUpdated` (set at publish time),
 * `artifacts.package` (filled in from the fetched tarball), `extensions`
 * (computed from the bundled manifest's capabilities + allowedHosts).
 *
 * The translation step lives in `./translate.ts`.
 *
 * Single-vs-multi-author convenience
 * ----------------------------------
 *
 * The lexicon stores `authors` and `security` as arrays. The overwhelmingly
 * common case is one author and one security contact, so the manifest
 * accepts both shapes:
 *
 *     // single-author
 *     { "author": { "name": "Jane Doe" }, "security": { "email": "..." } }
 *
 *     // multi-author
 *     { "authors": [{ "name": "..." }, { "name": "..." }],
 *       "securityContacts": [{ "email": "..." }] }
 *
 * `loadManifest` normalises both forms to the array shape before passing to
 * publish. You can't mix forms for the same field (e.g. `author` AND
 * `authors`); the schema rejects that.
 *
 * Strict mode
 * -----------
 *
 * Unknown keys are rejected with `.strict()`. This catches typos like
 * `"licens": "MIT"` rather than letting them silently fall through. The
 * tradeoff is that adding a field requires a CLI release; we accept that
 * cost for v1 and may revisit after one cycle of field-add (issue #1029).

/**
 * Programmatic API for `@emdash-cms/plugin-cli`.
 *
 * Most users will run the CLI binary `emdash-plugin`. This entry exists for
 * tooling -- editors, custom build scripts, or other CLIs -- that want to
 * invoke the same logic without spawning a subprocess.
 *
 * For discovery and credential storage, import from `@emdash-cms/registry-client`
 * directly. This package is the publisher-side surface (bundle, publish).
 *
 * EXPERIMENTAL: pin to an exact version while RFC 0001 is in flight.

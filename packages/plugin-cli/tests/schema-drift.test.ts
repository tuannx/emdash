/**
 * Guard against drift between the Zod source of truth and the committed
 * JSON Schema at `schemas/emdash-plugin.schema.json`.
 *
 * The committed JSON Schema is shipped to users via
 * `node_modules/@emdash-cms/plugin-cli/schemas/emdash-plugin.schema.json`
 * so editors can offer completion and validation without running our CLI.
 * If a contributor changes the Zod schema and forgets to regenerate, this
 * test fails with a clear "run pnpm gen-schema" instruction.
 *
 * We compare the schema contents after normalizing line endings to LF, then
 * re-running the same `toJSONSchema` call the generator script uses. The
 * generator's wrapping fields (`$id`, `title`, `description`) are added on
 * top so we replicate them here.

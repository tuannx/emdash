/**
 * Hang guard for D1 Sessions API databases.
 *
 * With the `global_fetch_strictly_public` compatibility flag set, the
 * internal request the D1 Sessions API makes to route queries to read
 * replicas is silently blocked by the runtime's fetch-isolation policy:
 * every query issued through `withSession()` hangs until the Worker is
 * killed, with no error logged (`outcome: "canceled"`, empty exceptions).
 * See https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1273.
 *
 * The guard races session queries against a timeout while the session
 * transport's health is unknown (i.e. until the first query settles in this
 * isolate). On a hang it:
 *
 * - latches the isolate as "broken" and logs one descriptive error,
 * - transparently re-executes plain SELECTs on the direct (non-session)
 *   binding — reads are idempotent, so a late completion of the hung call
 *   is harmless,
 * - rejects anything else with a descriptive error rather than silently
 *   re-running a write that might still complete.
 *
 * Once latched, `createRequestScopedDb` skips sessions entirely for the
 * rest of the isolate's life, so only requests already holding a session
 * db pay the timeout. Once a query settles (success or SQL error — either
 * proves the transport round-trips), the guard steps aside and queries
 * pass through with zero overhead.
 */

/**
 * How long a session query may stay unsettled before the guard declares the
 * session transport broken. D1 queries normally settle in tens of
 * milliseconds; five seconds is far beyond any healthy p99 while still an
 * order of magnitude quicker than waiting for the Worker to be killed.
 * Only queries issued while health is still "unknown" are raced at all.

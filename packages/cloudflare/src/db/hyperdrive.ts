/**
 * Cloudflare Hyperdrive runtime adapter - RUNTIME ENTRY
 *
 * Hyperdrive pools and accelerates connections to an existing PostgreSQL
 * (or PostgreSQL-compatible, e.g. PlanetScale Postgres) database, letting a
 * Worker reach it over Cloudflare's network with connection pooling and
 * query caching.
 *
 * Connection lifecycle on Workers
 * --------------------------------
 * A Worker isolate handles many requests, but a database connection (a TCP
 * socket) is bound to the request that opened it — it cannot be reused by a
 * later request. A module-global `pg.Pool` therefore breaks: the first request
 * works, then subsequent requests reusing the isolate's stale pool hang or
 * error with "Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request".
 *
 * So this adapter is request-scoped: `createRequestScopedDb` builds a fresh
 * `pg.Pool` + Kysely for each request and closes it once the response body has
 * finished streaming. EmDash's middleware stashes that per-request Kysely in
 * ALS, and the runtime/loader db getters prefer it over the singleton — so all
 * request-path queries use a connection opened in the current request.
 *
 * `createDialect` still builds the per-isolate singleton Kysely, used only for
 * cold-start migrations (which run inside the first request, so the socket is
 * valid there). Everything else resolves the connection from ALS at use-time:
 * the request path through the runtime/loader db getters, and the background and
 * plugin paths (Cron Trigger sweep, plugin hook contexts, media providers)
 * through resolvers threaded by the core runtime. The Cron Trigger handler opens
 * its own event-scoped connection for the sweep. So no warm-isolate path reuses
 * the singleton's request-bound socket across events.
 *
 * Known limitation — sandboxed plugins are D1-only. The sandbox plugin bridge
 * (a Durable Object) talks to a D1 binding directly, independent of the
 * configured adapter, so sandboxed plugins are not available on a Hyperdrive
 * deployment. This is a pre-existing bridge constraint, unrelated to connection
 * scoping; tracked in https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1623.
 *
 * This module imports directly from cloudflare:workers to access the binding.
 * Do NOT import it at config time — use { hyperdrive } from
 * "@emdash-cms/cloudflare" instead.
 *
 * Requirements (set in the consuming site's wrangler config):
 * - `compatibility_flags: ["nodejs_compat"]`
 * - `compatibility_date >= "2024-09-23"`
 * - `pg >= 8.16.3` installed in the site

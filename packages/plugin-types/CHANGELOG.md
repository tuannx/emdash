# @emdash-cms/plugin-types

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2002](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2002) [`e52dea9`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/e52dea9b72b043d62348f8d01eefade2ce66484c) Thanks [@jcheese1](https://github.com/jcheese1)! - Adds explicitly declared, administrator-enabled plugin MCP tools with per-route permissions, plugin-scoped token access, install and update consent, structured output schemas, and invocation auditing.

- [#1985](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1985) [`3f8b778`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/3f8b77822bf8e89b065884c53c7e8b7676788c48) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds a `cacheControl` option for public plugin routes: successful GET responses carry the configured `Cache-Control` header, enabling CDN and browser caching for public plugin endpoints. Works for native, standard, and marketplace plugin formats. Private routes and errors keep the `private, no-store` default.

- [#2067](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/2067) [`07c9f21`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/07c9f210db300803f49ecf2b8a18fe173e459a28) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds plugin manifest schema validation (`pluginManifestSchema`, `reconcileManifestAccess`) and declared-access canonicalization helpers (`canonicalizeDeclaredAccess`, `diffDeclaredAccess`, escalation detection, and the `CanonicalDeclaredAccess` types) for validating plugin manifests and comparing the access a plugin declares.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1719](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1719) [`7c5de08`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/7c5de08f6370ea88500b7ec425d58b2c82443260) Thanks [@swissky](https://github.com/swissky)! - Adds a `taxonomies:read` plugin capability with read-only taxonomy access: plugins that declare it get `ctx.taxonomies` to list taxonomy definitions (`getAll()`), fetch the terms of a taxonomy (`getTerms()`), and read the terms assigned to a content entry (`getEntryTerms()`) — in-process and in both sandbox runners.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1461](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1461) [`b01aa9b`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/b01aa9bbb436bcec07516b499eb0516cfbe414b4) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fixes registry installs failing with "Plugin manifest has changed since you consented" for plugins that declare hook-registration capabilities (email transport, email events, page fragments) or read user records. Plugin bundles now declare their access as a structured `declaredAccess` contract that the registry record, the install-consent dialog, and the sandbox all read consistently, so every capability a plugin declares is shown for consent and enforced — no capability is silently dropped. Re-publish affected plugins to adopt the new bundle format; existing installs are unaffected.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#923](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/923) [`943df46`](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/commit/943df46d62043df386eef4664fbba4710be16c31) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Adds `@emdash-cms/plugin-types`: shared TypeScript types for the EmDash plugin manifest contract — capability vocabulary (`PluginCapability`, `CAPABILITY_RENAMES`, `isDeprecatedCapability`, `normalizeCapability`), manifest shape (`PluginManifest`, `ManifestHookEntry`, `ManifestRouteEntry`, `PluginAdminConfig`, `PluginStorageConfig`). Consumed by both `emdash` (manifest reader at install/runtime) and `@emdash-cms/registry-cli` (manifest writer at bundle/publish time). After the registry phase 1 cutover removes the legacy bundling code from core, both sides will continue depending on this single source of truth.

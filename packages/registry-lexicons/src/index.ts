/**
 * @emdash-cms/registry-lexicons
 *
 * Generated TypeScript types and runtime validation schemas for the EmDash
 * plugin registry lexicons under `com.emdashcms.experimental.*`.
 *
 * EXPERIMENTAL: NSIDs and shapes will change. Once the registry stabilises the
 * NSIDs are expected to migrate to either `pm.fair.package.*` (if FAIR adopts the
 * shape) or `com.emdashcms.package.*`. Pin to an exact version while we iterate.
 *
 * The exports below are namespace re-exports so consumers can write:
 *
 *   import { PackageProfile } from "@emdash-cms/registry-lexicons";
 *   const profile: PackageProfile.Main = { ... };
 *
 * Each namespace exposes (where applicable):
 *   - `Main`, `<Def>` interfaces — the shape of records / XRPC params / outputs
 *   - `mainSchema`, `<def>Schema` — runtime validators from `@atcute/lexicons`
 *
 * The generated modules also augment `@atcute/lexicons/ambient` `Records` and
 * `XRPCQueries` so `@atcute/client` callers get strong typing automatically.

/**
 * Byline field-definitions cache
 *
 * Discussion #1174 / Phase 3. Two-tier cache for the byline custom-field
 * registry, mirroring the `settings/index.ts` pattern.
 *
 * **Tier 1 — per-isolate (globalThis).** Field definitions change rarely
 * but are read on every byline hydration (admin pages, content rendering,
 * API responses). Caching at the isolate level drops the SELECT-from-
 * `_emdash_byline_fields` from once-per-hydration to once-per-isolate-
 * after-bump. The cache holds a Promise (not the resolved value) so
 * concurrent cold-isolate readers share the in-flight query.
 *
 * Stored on globalThis under `Symbol.for("emdash:byline-field-defs")` so
 * Vite SSR chunk duplication can't produce two independent caches (same
 * pattern as `request-cache.ts` and `request-context.ts`).
 *
 * **Tier 2 — per-request.** Wraps both the version read and the defs
 * fetch in `requestCached` so a single page render that hits byline
 * hydration multiple times (e.g. list view + individual byline lookups
 * in a sidebar) pays at most one version read and one defs fetch in
 * total. The defs cache key includes the version, so a (highly
 * unlikely) mid-request bump still produces a self-consistent view —
 * the second call sees a different key and refetches.
 *
 * **Invalidation.** `options.byline_fields_version` is bumped by every
 * `BylineSchemaRegistry` mutation (Phase 2). Each isolate independently
 * reads the persisted version on the next request and compares against
 * its cached version; mismatch triggers a refetch and overwrite. Other
 * isolates see the change within one request after the bump propagates.
 *
 * **Isolated databases bypass the global cache.** Playground and DO
 * preview sessions set `requestContext.dbIsIsolated = true`, signalling
 * the per-request `db` points at an isolated schema that may diverge
 * from the singleton. Schema-derived caches keyed by the singleton's
 * version would silently leak the singleton's defs into the isolated
 * request. We follow the `loader.ts:74` `getTaxonomyNames` precedent:
 * skip both reading from and writing to the global holder when the
 * request is isolated. The per-request cache (`requestCached`) is keyed
 * by the WeakMap'd `EmDashRequestContext`, so it can't cross-pollinate
 * between requests — it stays in play even for isolated DBs.
 *
 * **Why a versioned cache and not a TTL?** The version counter gives
 * deterministic invalidation without the staleness window a TTL would
 * impose. Field-definition changes need to be visible to the next
 * request, not eventually. The cost is one cheap `options` read per
 * request — cheaper than the field-defs fetch it replaces, and cheaper
 * than maintaining a TTL state machine.
